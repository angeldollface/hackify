# HACKIFY :scroll: :woman_technologist: :spider_web:

***A small Vue.js app to replace letters with numbers.*** :scroll: :woman_technologist: :spider_web:

## ABOUT :books:

Since I recently wrote a C++ CLI application [that replaces letters with numbers](https://github.com/angeldollface/hack), where possible, and reimplemented this same functionality in a Javascript library, [hack.js](https://github.com/angeldollface/hack.js), I thought I'd make a nice web-interface for this application. This repository contains the source code for this web-app implementation using the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) framework.
